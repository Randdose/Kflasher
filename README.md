This should be self explanatory, but if something is confusing, or can be improved please let me know.

first click on the "select ISO" button and select an ISO file.

plug in the USB you want to flash, and click refresh, the device should appear in the drop down list.

select the device, and after making sure it's the right one, click "Flash!".

currently there's no progress bar, but you can check the progress of dd in the terminal.
